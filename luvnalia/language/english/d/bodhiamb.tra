@0    = ~You follow in the hopes of retrieving something dear to you. I say that the longer you keep this up, the more you will lose.~
@1    = ~Take young Nalia there. I understand you have developed a relationship of sorts. It's so hard on couples when something happens to one of them, don't you agree? ~
@2    = ~Ahh, but I do not speak for him, Nalia. I speak of you. This is a lesson, <CHARNAME>. Follow me and you will lose more than you could imagine. Starting now!~
@3    = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi appeared in an ambush shortly before I reached her haven, warning me that she was aware of my pursuit and stealing from me the one woman that is dearest to my heart: Nalia.  Before she vanished and unleashed more of her undead creations upon me, Bodhi warned me that if I continue I will lose even more than I thought possible.  I cannot give up on the Rhynn Lanthorn... but now the life and immortal soul of the one I love is at stake, as well!~
@4    = ~I have no fear for his well being, monster. ~
