## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview



The idea here is that older mods, whether TeamBG's TBG format or IAP or even older Weidu mods, will get a refresh to become more compatible with other mods.
So what is here? Well, any mod that I can "fix". Mods that don't seem to be supported by their owner anymore, and mods that you all ask me to update. The last one doesn't mean that every old mod out there can be updated. I do have one I have updated that isn't here. The owner is hosting on their own site (which is fine since it is his mod, not mine).
If you have dug up any old mods that don't work with other mods, give me a link to it, and I will try to see about updating the mod. After all, isn't having as many mods installed as possible the goal of all players?

ARNEL'S NALIA ROMANCE:


This is a Weidu-based version of the original mod. This mod is now in a Weidu format and can be installed with other mods for BG2.

Contact me at the Spellhold Studios forum if you have issues/problems.

The original mod can still be found at http://web.starman.ee/arnel/nalia/.

By the way, there is another Nalia romance mod in the works. It is called de'Arnise Romance and is hosted by the PocketPlaneGroup. I don't know if it has been released yet or not.
